- ~~implement gap between two consecutive subproofs of the same depth (clip frame line in every depth?)~~ scrapped for the restructuring
- fix dependence on font size and odd constantage
- implement dynamic or custom asm line length
- add customization
- ~~make it make sense~~ actually impossible. can use some tidying I guess
- restrict imports
- ~~rethink structure to fit asb lines: heights, lengths and indentation; discard asm-spacing, shorten height of first subproof framelines~~ done (scratched spb)
- model [fitch](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/fitch)?
- fix alignment dependence fuckery
- fix versioning
